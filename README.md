# Principal-Component-Analysis
Principal Component Analysis to differentiate between classes in different datasets.

In the realm of modern data analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) stands as a
foundational and indispensable technique. Its widespread adoption and relevance in various domains testify
to its significance in unraveling the complexities of datasets. The goals and principles of PCA are discussed
and identified less than the weight it carries. The goal of this paper is to provide insights on the procedure of
performing PCA on three datasets, the first of which will be a univariate normal distribution of 20 sample size
and the latter two will be wine classification dataset and iris flower classification dataset, standard datasets
collected from UCI machine learning repository. The paper then compares the results from performing PCA
manually to the existing way of PCA with the use of scikit-learn libraries. The paper aims to discuss the
fundamentals of PCA and the results of performing PCA on two different datasets.
